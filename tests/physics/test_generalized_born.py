    # This suggests I am calling `simulate.velocity_verlet(...)` and it expects `state`?

    # Maybe I imported wrong?

    # Let's look at the error again.

    # This error comes from the line `init_fn, apply_fn = simulate.velocity_verlet(energy_fn, shift_fn, dt)`?

    # If it's from the generator call, then `velocity_verlet` might not be the generator but the step function itself?
    # No, `simulate.velocity_verlet` is usually the setup.

    # Let's assume I need to use `simulate.nve` which might be the high level wrapper?
    # Or `simulate.velocity_verlet` is correct.

    # Let's try to fix by checking if I need to provide more args.
    # In JAX MD, `velocity_verlet` often requires `mass` if it's not 1.0?

    # Let's try a simpler integrator `simulate.nve` if available, or just fix `velocity_verlet`.
    # Actually, let's look at `simulate.py` to see how `nvt_langevin` is called.
    # `init_fn, apply_fn = simulate.nvt_langevin(energy_fn, shift_fn, dt, kT, gamma)`

    # So `velocity_verlet` should be similar.
    # Maybe I am missing `mass` in the setup?

    # Let's try:
    # init_fn, apply_fn = simulate.velocity_verlet(energy_fn, shift_fn, dt)

    # If that fails, maybe I should check if `velocity_verlet` is actually `nvt_nose_hoover` or similar?
    # No, `velocity_verlet` is standard.

    # Let's try to debug by printing or just using a standard NVE loop manually if needed.
    # But `jax_md` should have it.

    # Maybe the error is in `apply_fn(s)`?
    # "lambda i, s: apply_fn(s)"

    # Wait, the error "missing 1 required positional argument: 'state'" usually happens when you call a method that expects self/state but don't provide it?

    # Let's try to use `simulate.nve` if it exists.
    # Or just implement Verlet manually since it's simple.
